Issues](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-service-mesh/issues)

We use issues for bug reports and to discuss new features. 
Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better. 
Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us
figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs
because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even
more. Please follow these guidelines for filing issues:

* Describe the problem Include version of k8s, `nginx-meshctl version`, and what K8s platform. 
* Include detailed information about how to recreate the issue 
* Include relevant configuration, error messages and logs 
* Sanitize the data. For example, be mindful of IPs, ports, application names and URLs

**NOTE**

Support for NSM is not currently available via traditional NGINX or F5
support channels.  All support is through the community at [NSM Git
Issues](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-service-mesh/issues)

**NGINX Plus KIC Support**

When running NSM with NGINX Plus Ingress Controller for Kubernetes
integration, support for NGINX Plus Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC),
when deploying NGINX Plus KIC with NGINX Service Mesh, is still available
through traditional channels.

Existing NGINX and F5 customers can reach out to their accout team(s) for
