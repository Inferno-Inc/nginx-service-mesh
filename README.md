We use issues for bug reports and to discuss new features. Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better. Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even more. 

All issues should follow these guidelines:

- Describe the problem. Include version of Kubernetes, `nginx-meshctl version`, and what Kubernetes platform.
- Include detailed information about how to recreate the issue.
- Include relevant configurations, error messages, and logs.
- Sanitize the data. For example, be mindful of IPs, ports, application names, and URLs.
